# OpenJDK Project Skara

The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.

This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
repository:

- git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
- git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
- git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
- git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
- git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
- git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
- git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
- git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
- git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools

There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
[Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:

- git-openjdk-import
- git-verify-import
- hg-openjdk-import

The following server-side tools (so called "bots") for interacting with
external Git source code hosting providers are available:

- hgbridge - continously convert Mercurial repositories to git
- mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
- notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
- pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
- submit - example pull request test runner

## Building

[JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
5.2.1 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or
GNU/Linux, just run the following command from the source tree root:

```bash
$ sh gradlew
```

To build the project on Windows, run the following command from the source tree root:

```bat
> gradlew
```

The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
tree root.

It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
(including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
source tree root:

```bash
sh gradlew images
```

## Installing

To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
GNU/Linux:

```bash
$ git config --global include.path "$PWD/skara.gitconfig"
```

On Windows:

```bat
> git config --global include.path "%CD%/skara.gitconfig"
```

To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.

## Testing

[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.3.1 or later is required to run the unit
tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:

```bash
$ sh gradlew test
```

The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and
[Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on
your system.

This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
source tree root:

```bash
$ sh gradlew reproduce
```
